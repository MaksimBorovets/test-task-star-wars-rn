Star Wars Favorites Mobile Application
Task:
Implement the mobile application based on React Native for iOS & Android platforms that gives the ability to indicate the total amount of male/female/other favourite characters across the Star Wars Universe. 
Statements:
Make an API Request to get the information from the server.
Display the list of retrieved elements.
By clicking on any element of this list - extra information should be displayed on the dedicated screen.
By clicking on the “Add to favourites” link/icon against any character - recalculate the total votes and indicate the selected element as the liked one. 
Display total amounts of male/female/other characters based on the user's selection.
The “Reset” button should flush all previously added to the favourites list personages and make all total values equal to zero.
API:

Reference:

Requirements:
We need the main screen with a scrollable and paginated list of elements that navigate the user to another screen with additional information about the selected entity.
The application should allow users to add list elements to favourites and calculate totals based on male/female/etc. gender.
The “Reset” button should flush all the statistics to the initial state.
It’s possible to use any state management approach.
It’s allowed to use any UI library/framework to style the application.
It’s recommended to follow the referenced stylings or it’d be a plus to customize it due to your preferences and/or best UX/UI practices.
The codebase of this application should be uploaded to GitHub public repository with relevant README information.


We will assess the next parts:
workability: how your application works;
projects structure: how you structure your files;
code quality: how you write clean, readable code (feel free to install and use ESLint and Prettier);
knowledge React, React Native and their ecosystem: how you compose and use libraries together;
